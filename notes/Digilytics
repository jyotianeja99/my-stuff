s1 = "jyoti"
s2 = "aneja"
s1.concat(s2) -- how many objects will be created?





when s1 and s2 are received as run time arguments?

different mappings in Spring Boot...

Xml as the transfer object--

Shallow copy vs Deep copy-- 

ArrayList vs LinkedList--


in one comparator: any number of properties..?



{Student(name,age,class), ...,  }

classes.. based on names, based on age  -- in one comparator.

HashMap:  --internal working


10 key value pairs.. 
inserted into HashMap..

Order?
For sorting?


LOBs - Large objects

BLOBs - Binary large objects - image,video etc
- 4gb allowed



CLOBs - Character " " ""
  	- 4gb max. - pdf, .txt .xml etc

Steps:

1. Create table Persons(name varchar(30), image BLOB);
2. Create File object to represent image
File f = new File("kat.jpg");
3. Create FIS to read binary data:
FIS fs = new FIS(f);
PreparedStmt = conn.createStatement("insert into Persons values(?,?"));
stmt.setString(1,"Kat");
stmt.setBinaryStream(2, fis);
int rc = stmt.executeUpdate();
IF(RC == 0)
SOP("RECORD NOT INSERTED")
ELSE
SOP("record inserted")
