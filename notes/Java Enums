Java Enums:

- they are classes which have a fixed set of constants.
- all fields are static and final.
- can be inside he class or outside the class.
- java enum internally inherits from Enum class and therefore cannot inherit from any other class.
- Enum can contain constructors, fields, methods and main method.

Enum improves type safety. It can be traversed and therefore can be easily used in switch cases.

Java compiler internally adds values(), valueOf() and ordinal() at compile time. It internally creates a static and final class for the enum.

values() - returns an array containing all values of the enum.
valueOf() - java compiler internally adds this method at compile time. This method returns the value of the enum constant.
ordinal() - This method returns the index of the enum value.

Constructor of enum is private. If you don't declare constructor private, the compiler creates one, implicitly.
