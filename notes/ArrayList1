   ArrayList: It has 3 constructors.But we mostly use first constructor.

   Resizeable array/growable array- underlying data structures.
   Duplicates are allowed.
   Insertion order is preserved.
   Heterogeneous objects can be inserted in a list.
   Heterogeneous allowed everywhere xcept TreeSet and TreeMap(because of sorting required)
   Null insertion is possible.

   Constructors:

   ArrayList list = new ArrayList<>();
   An empty object wil be created here with default capacity of 10. When the limit is reached ie. 10 elements have been inserted, a new object will be created with new capacity as:
   New capacity = (current capacity*3/2)+1
   All elements will be copied from old array to this new array and reference variable will point to new object.

   Flaw: When 1000 objects are to be inserted.

   2. ArrayList l = new ArrayList<>(1000);

ArrayList l = new ArrayList<>(Collection c);  --treeset to arraylist etc.
