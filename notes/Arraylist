Arraylist

ArrayList in java:
Arraylist is a part of collection framework. It is the implementation of dynamic array. It may be slower than the standard array but it is very useful where a lot of manipulation of data is required.

ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();

- arraylist, part of java.util package.
- inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.
- ArrayList is initialized by a size, size is variable, can be increased or decreased as required.
- Java arraylist allows us to randomly access an element.
- It can be used for primitive data types, that's where wrapper classes come in place.

ArrayList is a dynamic sized array, we do not have o specify size while creating an arraylist. We can dynamically add and remove elements. It automatically resizes itself.

Internal working of ArrayList:
Basic idea when array becomes full and user wishes to add more elements:
- Create a bigger sized memory on heap memory.(eg double size)
- Copy current memory elements to the new memory.
- New element is added now as there is bigger memory available.
- Delete the old memory.

Applications:
- where we need to list elements having variable length.

Created?
Created by methods as well as constructors.

Consructors:
ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<>(Collection c);
ArrayList<>(int capacity);
